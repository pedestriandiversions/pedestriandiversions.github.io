<h2>Transcript</h2>

<p>
These colourful terraces of houses strung along the hillsides have become a firm part of Bristol’s visual identity.  I don’t want to say ‘iconic’, because that’s such an overused/diluted word, but look at tourist collateral for example, or local murals or signs, and you’ll see that these colourful terraces are widely emblematic of today’s Bristol cityscape.
<p></p>
It helps that they’re located fairly everywhere, visible from almost everywhere, not confined to one particular ‘colourful neighbourhood’ as in some other cities.  These ones in Cliftonwood conspicuously overlook the harbour, of course, but these ones overlook you when you step off a train at Temple Meads, these ones extend far into the un-touristy suburbs, and there are countless similar examples across the city.
<p></p>
Somehow I found myself pondering these terraces deeper than strictly necessary. When, where and why did this start? Is there anything either forcing or preventing particular homeowners from doing it, or is it a total free for all?
<p></p>
I did some digging and frankly the answers I found to these questions were rather fuzzy.  But, I went ahead and made a video about it anyway.
<p></p>
The history may be a bit vague, but it’s not an entirely historic story - architecturally, this is very much an ongoing, present day trend, with this grassroots / vernacular visual aesthetic increasingly being consciously integrated into the very fabric of the city by 21st century architects and developers.
<p></p>
But let’s start with the historic stuff.
<p></p>
The first thing to point out is that we’re
dealing with colourful historic terraces,

not historic colourful terraces.

That is to say, as far as I could determine
there’s no particular evidence that these

paint jobs date back to the construction of
the houses, or anywhere near it, while there’s

a moderate amount of evidence that the colour
schemes didn’t turn up until later.

And by later I mean, like, 150, maybe even
200 years later - because some of these houses

are pretty old.
<p></p>
The archetypal Bristol terrace is Georgian.

Not that kind of Georgian, but the built-under-the-reigns-of-the-first-four-king-Georges
kind; in other words, strictly speaking, between

1714 and 1830, but since nobody wants to mess
around inventing a William the Fourthian era

for only seven years, we can we usually chuck
most 1830s buildings in with the Georgian

era too.
<p></p>
Bristol does have early Georgian stuff, but
the colourful terraces we’re focussing on

here tend to be from the later end of this
era.

These prominent ones on Redcliffe Parade are
relatively old, being from 1768-71.

These ones on Queen’s Parade are from c1794.

More often we find early 19th century construction
- for example, these ones from circa 1820,

these ones are from about 1825,these ones
began as early as 1791 but soon went on hold,

and were not completed til 1827.
<p></p>
A few features are worth drawing attention
to.

Firstly, we can see they are usually 4 stories
high.

It’s the 1700s and four stories is the default.

This is why I feel justified in rolling my
eyes at the numerous and inevitable NIMBY

complaints on planning applications that anything
bigger than a 2 storey semi-detached is “out

of scale” or not in keeping with traditional
British urbanism.
<p></p>
We can see that although these terraces extend
for considerable distances, unbroken, with

a clean, unvarying line along the street,
they are saved from being oppressively wall-like

horizontal slab-blocks by two things: firstly,
that they are draped in elegant curves across

undulating terrain, and secondly, by their
narrow vertical grain.
<p></p>
That is to say, although the terraces are
very wide, each individual property is tall

and narrow.
<p></p>
By this era, a block like this built in, say,
Paris might well have been divided up like

this, so each household occupies a floor.

For whatever reason, England stuck resolutely
to dividing them like this.

Of course, many of them today are subdivided
into separate flats like this, and some of

them would have been sublet like that from
the earliest days; and.even those notionally

occupied by a single household would likely
have accommodated servants in the basement.
<p></p>
Still, regardless of how the interiors came
to be portioned out, the street frontage still

presents as a series of narrow individual
houses.

It’s hopefully pretty obvious how this would
later feed into our rainbow effect.
<p></p>
In terms of material, some are built of stone;
in this particular part of the world that’s

usually Bath stone or another, similar type
of local limestone.

These ones are perhaps rather unlikely to
be painted since the stone itself is a highly

esteemed finish.
<p></p>
The majority, though, were built from cheaper
brick or rubble, and given a smooth exterior

finish with a layer of stucco, which likewise
serves as a sort of prerequisite for the sort

of painting which would follow.
<p></p>
I think it’s also worth pointing out that
ornamentation is at an absolute minimum on

these buildings.

There’s no polychromatic brickwork or sculpture
which would be obscured by a layer of paint.

Most of these houses lack even any semi-decorative,
semi-structural features such as bay windows,

or even lintels on the windows.
<p></p>
Pediments and theatrical cornices are right
out - in fact, even the one non-rectangular

feature a British house is pretty much guaranteed
to have, a slanting roof, is often deliberately

obscured by a continuous horizontal parapet.

The result is that each house presents as
a sparse, flat, minimalist rectangle.
<p></p>
Once again, you can hopefully see for yourself
how this creates an ideal canvas for our later

trend, in a way that more intricate or ornate
architecture would not.
<p></p>
Compare these, for example - you just can’t
imagine the rainbow thing catching on in the

same way if Bristol was dominated with residential
stock like this..

Sometimes, streets of these houses do attempt
to join in the colourfully-painted bandwagon,

and fair play to them, it’s still bright
and likeable, but... as you can probably see,

it just doesn’t really work the same way.
<p></p>
Georgian era terraces may be the archetype,
but numerically speaking most of these terraces

are actually Victorian.

Since Victorian houses are so commonplace
as to not be individually listed, it proved

difficult for me to pin down exact dates.

Conservation Area documentation tends to only
offer more general classification: these for

example are “mid Victorian”, while these
are “late Victorian”.
<p></p>
It seems to me that there’s a remarkable
degree of continuity in design across all

these eras, which is a pretentious way of
saying they all look pretty much the same

to me.
<p></p>
In London I thought I had developed a reasonably
good eye for roughly guessing the age of residential

buildings.

Georgian Georgian looks like this - all red
brick and sash windows.

Regency Georgian looks like this, with stucco
and white paint.

Victorian - Late Victorian especially - could
never be confused with either, since it totally

abandons the minimalist (lack of) ornamentation,
the clean unbroken roof and street lines,

and so on, in favour of twiddly stuff like
this, covered in bay windows and pediments

and little turrets and pointy bits everywhere…
<p></p>
With Bristol’s terraces though, these stereotypes
of mine prove rather useless.

If I didn’t have sources to tell me that
these two were from the Georgian and Victorian,

I would readily guesstimate them to be of
the same vintage.
<p></p>
This certainly isn’t because the more overtly
Victorian styles passed Bristol by.

There are plentiful examples of Victorians
doing their twiddly, gothicky stuff here…

I did a whole video about some of them in
fact.

So it is seems to me, although this is admittedly
complete speculation, there must have been

a somewhat conscious decision on the part
of Bristolian planners and/or house-builders

to continue to emulate the Georgian terraces;
some recognition that despite the changing

fashions of the 19th century, this was still
a worthy template to copy-paste across the

city.
<p></p>
What about these pastel rainbow paint jobs
then?
<p></p>
We’ve seen how the local architecture has
some properties ideally suited to enabling

this trend, but that doesn’t explain when
or why it actually did start.
<p></p>
A quick poke around online reveals a few theories.
<p></p>
The first points to the fact that Bristol
is a port city, and many other famously-colourful

towns like Cinque Terre in Italy are also
coastal.

Apparently, fishermen and sailors liked to
paint their houses bright colours so they

could see their homes from a distance when
returning from sea.
<p></p>
And I’m afraid to say my natural reaction
to this theory is to consider it complete

drivel.

Well, I mean, I don’t know about everywhere
around the world, it may be true somewhere.

But in Bristol at least however it seems like
folksy nonsense to me.
<p></p>
For starters, even though economically speaking
Bristol was very much a port city, it’s

not like a majority of the population were
fishermen or sailors of any kind even in the

1800s, let alone now.
<p></p>
And let’s be blunt, the type of humble illiterate
fisherman who needs to paint his house bright

yellow to be able to find it, was certainly
not likely to be the owner of a luxury south-facing

Georgian townhouse in the upmarket and fashionable
new suburb of Clifton.
<p></p>
Also, the tortuous topography of Bristol means
even if you could say “hey, there’s my

house!” as you sailed in, you’d certainly
lose sight of it by the time you moored up

and started walking home anyway.
<p></p>
Similarly, I encountered some suggestions
that this all stems from Bristol’s artsy,

bohemian vibe, with the inevitable reference
to Banksy.
<p></p>
While it’s rather self-evidently true that
colourful houses will arise in a town where

the population are open-minded to the prospect
of colourful houses, the idea that Banksy

has anything to do with this, I can only imagine
is rooted in the apparent journalistic law

whereby any piece about Bristol must name-drop
him.

By the same token I’m actually rather surprised
nobody has tried to credit this trend to Brunel.
<p></p>
I also encountered a rumour that it all began
because a Totterdown decorator found himself

with a job lot of colourful paint, and offered
a discount house-painting as a way to get

rid of it and drum up some business.

This one is somehow both entirely plausible
and reeking of urban myth, and I don’t really

see much way of me investigating it, short
of appealing for people to pipe up in the

comments if they know anything.
<p></p>
A more interesting theory that popped up was
that this trend was initiated by a chap called

George Ferguson in the 1960s, although my
instinctive reaction was equally sceptical.
<p></p>
Firstly because it seems a bit too good to
be true to be able to tie this sort of phenomenon

to a single individual; and secondly, because
that individual also just happens to be a

former mayor of Bristol, and without wishing
to be too cynical, if anybody has an incentive

to encourage a mythos of themselves as innovators
and single-handed drivers of city-wide change,

it’s politicians.
<p></p>
On closer inspection however, it seems maybe
I was being too cynical, because before he

was a politician, he was an architect with
particular interest in regeneration, so the

idea of him being at the forefront of a movement
to brighten up the built environment starts

sounding like the absolute opposite of far-fetched.

Also, to be blunt, he is still alive, so we
can just ask him whether or not it’s true,

and a woman called Angie Parker who wrote
a blog post on this same subject, interviewed

him to do exactly that, confirming at least
part of the story.
<p></p>
His house was here, on Ambrose Road in Cliftonwood,
and he painted it red in 1966; he recalls

his friend down the street painting another
house blue at the same time.

So, with two houses on the same street - and
a very prominently visible street overlooking

the harbour, at that - being painted at the
same time, we do have a believable nucleus

from which this phenomenon could have snowballed.
<p></p>
Still, I couldn’t help but to remain slightly
sceptical.

This may have been one of the first, but THE
first, really?

It’s the sort of thing that’s impossible
to prove, so instead I tried hitting the archives

to see if I could DIS-prove it by finding
any photos or artwork of Bristol from the

1950s or before with these rainbow-colourful
terraces already clearly present.
<p></p>
The short version is that I couldn’t find
any such picture - but of course, absence

of evidence is not evidence of absence.

I did find some black and white shots like
this one from the 1920s, which do indicate

the colour of houses videos vary within a
terrace, although this could be a not-exactly-colourful

variation - a range of different whites and
off-whites mixed with unpainted stone or pebbledash

finishes - as seen here in the present day.
<p></p>
So my best guess is that while these terraces
would probably have had slightly varying shades

as individual homeowners’ maintenance and
repainting schedules diverged - and the occasional

eccentric may have opted for blue or pink
a century before it was cool - the trend probably

didn’t become a seriously ubiquitous, city-wide
thing until the latter part of the 20th century.
<p></p>
As history goes I confess this is a tad unsatisfying.

However, I don’t want this channel to be
all about history, and this particular story

extends to the present day in a rather interesting
way.
<p></p>
Whatever the precise genesis, most people
do seem to agree that the historic growth

of these rainbow houses was a grassroots,
‘bottom-up’ citizen-led process, and not

the result of some organised scheme led by
an artist or imposed by local authorities

and planners.

In the twenty-first century, however, authorities,
planners and architects are consciously stoking

these fires.

And it’s not just limited to consciously
cultivating more of these paint jobs on existing

housing stock.
<p></p>
It goes further than that, with contemporary
architects taking aspects of these colourful

terraces and building it into the very fabric
of their infill developments.
<p></p>
In 2017 architects Stride Treglown and local
photographer Jess Siggers held a ‘Bristol

Colour Capital’ seminar, with talks from
housing developers on their choice of colour

scheme, from city council marketing officers
on their use of these houses in promotional

literature, and so on.

The fact this ‘Colour Capital’ seminar
was held at Paintworks, where a bunch of Stride

Treglown-designed colourful houses and apartments
had recently come onto the market, might prompt

a cynic to suggest that it was an exercise
in property marketing as much or more than

it was an academic inquiry into a vernacular
aesthetic.
<p></p>
Still, I don’t think this trend can be dismissed
as entirely a marketing gimmick.

Reading through planning documents for this
section of the video, I did get the impression

that a lot of the architects, many of whom
are local firms, have a genuine interest in

reflecting the historic housing stock.
<p></p>
Anyway, we’ll visit Paintworks shortly,
but the obvious place to start is with these

ones which have been staring us in the face
for much of the preceding footage.
<p></p>
Perhaps surprisingly for such a clearly local-site-specific
design, these ones were not designed by a

local operation.

They were designed by HLN Architects who seem
to be based in Cardiff, although Bristol Council’s

City Design Group does also claim some credit
for ‘urban design advice’.
<p></p>
Researching 21st century buildings is surprisingly
hard, as architects routinely cull projects

from their websites and google returns nothing
but an overwhelming tidal wave of property

sales and rental websites and adverts.

My only concrete source of facts was local
planning documentation, so unless otherwise

stated, the years I cite are the years of
the planning application.

It was simply too difficult to get concrete
info on the year an architect actually did

the design, or the year a scheme was actually
completed.

On that basis, I’ll label this scheme as
from 2001.
<p></p>
There’s a lot I really like about these.

It’s not just that the colour palette is
absolutely spot on.

It’s also that this horizontal slab of housing
has been so clearly articulated into the sort

of narrow vertical grain we discussed earlier.
<p></p>
Personally, I also love the way they are simultaneously
very modern, unapologetically so.

They respond to the Georgian and Victorian
terraces without entirely aping them, the

bold ‘cut out’ shape is composed of stark
2d rectangles even though the overall house

is no longer a single 2d rectangle.
<p></p>
One thing I’m less keen on is the way they
sort of ‘cheat’.

And by that I don’t mean that the back of
this terrace doesn’t look at all similar,

nor colourful.

Because that often applies to the historic
ones too.

No, what irks me slightly is that even the
front fails to fully commit.

From most angles you can’t really tell,
but from a few it’s more apparent - these

nicely crisp, pastel facades are not 2 storey
houses, but actually the top 2 stories of

a 4 storey construction, the lower half of
which is built in that strain of orange brick

that I think of as ‘80s business park brick’.
<p></p>
I personally struggle to understand why an
architect would choose that here, or indeed

anywhere, but to be fair, it is hardly noticeable
from most angles, and overall I think the

good parts of this development far outweigh
the appearance of this personal bugbear.
<p></p>
Overlooking a small park in Bedminster, the
architect behind this row, as far as I can

tell, was a firm called Dexter Building Designs,
who could hardly be more local, being based

in Bedminster.
<p></p>
This site used to be some sort of factory
or industrial space called Temple Works, and

although I couldn’t find a photo of it,
it’s probably fair to assume that this development

meshes into the surrounding residential area
better than it did.

This is a bit of a running theme and I think
when architects do this sort of thing it can

be a bit thankless.

It’s like that Futurama quote, when you
do things right, people won’t be sure you’ve

done anything at all.

If you dump some intrusive or jarring into
an established ensemble of buildings then

people are very quick to moan about how modern
architecture is terrible, but if you replace

something ugly and jarring with something
that fits really nicely, people take to it

so quickly, it can become almost instantly
taken for granted.
<p></p>
The planning app is from 2012 although seems
to be an evolution of earlier designs.

I thought it’d be interesting to trawl the
design statements for the architects’ own

explanations of how their work was intended
to relate to existing stock, and in this case

it says:
<p></p>
The contemporary design of the development
would sit comfortably with the period properties

in the surrounding area.

The proportions of the individual facades
of the proposed dwellinghouses[sic] reflect

that of the period residential dwellings in
the vicinity.
<p></p>
The variety in coloured facades and textured
surfaces, allied with the verandas and cantilevered

bay windows,serve to add character and visual
interest to the principal elevation.
<p></p>
Much like the ones over the harbour, I rate
these highly for incorporating these classic

proportions and colours but retaining an unabashedly
crisp contemporary style.
<p></p>
Just across the same park lies another example.

Approach from this direction and you might
not think this development belongs in this

video, but turn around, and you can see a
slightly less pastel version of our rainbow

palette on the side walls of the double height
entrances.
<p></p>
This row was also built on top of a former
factory, and somewhat bafflingly the design

statement cites the “bright colours of the
factory” as inspiration, rather than Bristol

houses.

Bafflingly, because the only thing that seemed
especially colourful about the former factory

was the graffiti all over it.
<p></p>
The factory is actually a rather interesting
story worthy of a brief historical detour.

It was an outpost of the Industrial Therapy
Organisation, a scheme for the rehabilitation

of long-stay, long-unemployed psychiatric
patients in Bristol hospitals.

They worked 25 hours a week, paid the going
rate for light industrial work such as manufacturing

ball-point pens or dismantling telephones.
<p></p>
A Lancet article in 1963 reports that in the
first two years “The paranoid schizophrenics

were the most successful group, 21 out of
57 being placed in open employment.

Other forms of schizophrenia had the lowest
success rate, with only 13 patients from 98

placed in open work.”
<p></p>
Back to the factory’s replacement though,
and this time the architects, Bristol firm

105 West talk of aiming to “create a traditionally
proportioned front elevation of appropriate

formality overlooking the park...

The houses uniformly step up Lydstep Terrace
in response to the rising topography and thus

create a rhythm to the street, again in reference
to Bristol’s tradition.”
<p></p>
One thing that interests me with this design
is that the vertical articulation is essentially

provided solely by that stepping up, and the
drainpipes.

I can’t quite work out if I think this is
an inadequate expression of grain, resulting

in something that feels too much like a horizontal
block of flats rather than a series of houses,

or if it’s a sort of minimalist, prosaically
structural-expressionist stroke of genius.
<p></p>
I like this perhaps a little less than its
near-neighbour, but overall I’d give it

a positive assessment nonetheless.
<p></p>
The same cannot be said for all the developments
I discovered in making this video, unfortunately.

Here for example, we find a nice little set
of mews houses, in our rainbow palette, and,

in the very loosest sense, somewhat neo-Georgian
in their unadorned, well-proportioned-rectangles

aesthetic - but zoom out, and they’re built
into this… thing.
<p></p>
This Fitzroy Robinson scheme looked screamingly
Blair-era to me, and the planning app duly

turned up dated 2000.

Probably the nicest thing I can say about
the yellow brick and glass bits of the building

is that they provide an extremely clear example
of what happens if you don’t follow any

of the principles I’m discussing in this
video.
<p></p>
Let’s move swiftly on.
<p></p>
Where that scheme had contextually a fitting
terrace at ground floor level, and jettisoned

all attempts at localism or visual integration
above that, this 2011 project does something

of the opposite.

The ground floor makes no attempt to present
itself as a terrace of housing, being quite

clearly a supermarket, but the storeys above
minic the historic terraces along this street.

Like our earlier examples, this one replaced
some shabby industrial buildings that were

completely out of place, and you have to give
Bristol-based architects O’Leary Goss credit

for respectfully filling in this street, at
least from this key angle.
<p></p>
Somewhat disappointingly though, step down
the side street and you see that once again

the vision is not remotely carried through.

You’ve got the historic terrace, and then
you’ve got… these.

Very blocky, horizontal and generic.
<p></p>
Now, I don’t want to suggest I think every
development should be heritage terrace pastiche.

Pragmatically, with the housing shortage in
this country I understand the need to deliver

some denser, blockier developments, and stylistically
I’d be totally amenable for these other

blocks to be a radically different style,
contrasting rather than emulating, but the

style seen here is what I might politely describe
as ‘not compelling’.
<p></p>
If we’re talking about developments that
tip their hat to our colourful terraces whilst

delivering something actually rather bigger
and denser, I was rather more impressed by

Paintworks.

This is a big site with multiple phases of
development and multiple architects contributing,

but I’m pretty sure the bits I’m mostly
looking at in this video are by Stride Treglown,

planning application from 2009..
<p></p>
Although the pastel colours have been relegated
to something of a highlight role, you can

see how this large horizontal block on the
right has been articulated into a series of

tall and narrow properties as we’ve discussed.

No continuous horizontal parapet here - the
pointed roofs could be a reference to the

nearest historic stock, but I think more likely
a nod to the factory buildings which remain

a part of this site.
<p></p>
Yet again we see the use of cantilevered bay
windows; it seems contemporary architects

are more keen on the proportions of the classic
terrace house than their flat, near-2D style,

with most of them opting to add more 3-dimensionality.

Personally I find the net result is a bit
cluttery, although to be fair I have the same

opinion about Edwardian houses, so that’s
more a matter of taste than a criticism really.
<p></p>
One thing which weirdly fascinates me about
these developments is that these colours are

(probably, mostly) not a coat of paint.

Rather, I imagine developers are using through-renders
or cladding where the colour is part of the

material.

This means these colours are, essentially,
permanent - which led me to a strange hypothetical

scenario.

50, or 100 years in the future, if everybody
in Bristol deems this trend incredibly passe

and paints their houses uniformly white, these
buildings would endure as a reminder of the

trend, a physical embodiment of the once popular
and widespread palette, that's now looked

back as a 20th or 21st thing, "how dated!"
<p></p>
Anyway I’ll bring this video to a close
now because it’s already three times longer

than I intended it to be, but I should point
out I’m only scratching the surface with

this selection of projects.

I kept accidentally stumbling upon other schemes
with similar traits as I filmed this.

For example, I went up to Totterdown to film
the colourful Victorian terraces, and what

did I find?

Yet another modern take.

Here’s another small row I stumbled on near
Brandon Hill.
<p></p>
Also, you could argue that my focus on the
colours is a bit shallow.

There are lots of schemes which use the arguably
more important grain and proportions of classic

terraces with a modern sensibility, but eschew
the rainbow paint job.

These ones for example, and I really like
this street, too.

Perhaps one day the owners here might add
rainbow colours.

Who knows?
<p></p>
Anyway that’s all for this video.

As always thanks to all the people whose work
I’ve built on in any way, and thank you

for watching.
<p></p>
To be honest if anybody has actually made
it this far I’m kind of amazed.
<p></p>
If you did like this video, please consider
subscribing, in case I make any more.

Cheers.
